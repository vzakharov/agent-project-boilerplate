# Backlog analyst rules

**You are a backlog analyst on a whole-backlog audit sweep. Read all of this
before judging anything.** Your bucket, its remit, your item numbers, and where
to write your report come from the prompt that sent you here.

Read `tmp/audit/analyst-context.md` first, and judge every item against what it
says — not against what the item assumes. It is this run's description of the
repo: what shipped, what was retired and what replaced it, what the live
architecture is. An item written against a subsystem that no longer exists is
only judgeable once you know that.

## Where the material is

The threads are already dumped, so **read files — do not hammer the GitHub API.**
Hundreds of items × N agents of `gh api` calls is slow, rate-limited, and blocks
the whole run.

- `tmp/audit/issues/<n>.md` — full thread per open issue: body, labels, dates, all comments
- `tmp/audit/prs/<n>.md` — the same per open PR, plus its base and head refs
- `tmp/audit/rot.md`, `rot.json` — per-PR rot: behind/ahead, files, overlap, gone, merge verdict
- `tmp/audit/pr-history.json` — every PR ever, with `base.ref`

Read the repo itself with Read/Grep/Glob, and use `git` freely (`log`, `grep`, `-S`).

## Verdicts — exactly one per item

| Verdict             | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLOSE_DONE`        | The work described is done. Cite what did it.                         |
| `CLOSE_NOT_PLANNED` | Obsolete or abandoned — real once, but nobody will do it now.          |
| `CLOSE_DUPLICATE`   | Another issue covers it. **Name it as `#<n>` in your reason.**         |
| `REFILE`            | The framing no longer fits the code: it needs rewriting, not keeping.  |
| `KEEP`              | Still reads true against today's code.                                |
| `UNSURE`            | Needs a human. Say precisely what you could not establish.            |

Write the verdict **exactly** as spelled above. The three closing verdicts are
separate because GitHub's close reason is: they become `completed`,
`not_planned`, and `duplicate` respectively when the plan is executed. A bare
`CLOSE` is rejected as malformed — "closed, reason unstated" is what this
replaced. Choose honestly: a wrong-but-plausible `CLOSE_DONE` is worse than an
accurate `CLOSE_NOT_PLANNED`, because it claims work exists that does not.

Two rules, not preferences:

1. **Age is never a reason to close.** An old issue that still reads true is
   `KEEP`. Some issues get _worse_ while sitting — if a duplicate count or a
   scope has grown since it was filed, say so.
2. **`REFILE` is a framing mismatch, not a wish.** "Still a good idea, nobody did
   it" is `KEEP`. `REFILE` is for an item whose named paths, symbols, or
   architecture are gone.

## Priority — on every item that survives

A verdict says whether an item is still true; a priority says when it should be
worked. Without one the sweep hands back a backlog of the same size in the same
undifferentiated order, so **every `KEEP` and every `REFILE` carries a tier** —
for a `REFILE` it is the tier the replacement issue should be filed at. The
closing verdicts and `UNSURE` carry none: `—` in the column, since a schedule for
work nobody will do is noise, and an `UNSURE` cannot be scheduled before a human
resolves it.

| Tier | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `P0` | Harm is happening now and will not stop on its own — users hitting a broken path in production, data being corrupted or lost, a security or billing hole, a deploy lane that is down. |
| `P1` | A real defect or a cost the team pays repeatedly, but the app works: a bug with a workaround, a recurring incident source, debt actively slowing changes in code touched weekly.      |
| `P2` | A genuine improvement with a bounded payoff and no clock on it — consistency, coverage, cleanup in code nobody is currently fighting. Worth doing when someone is already there.      |
| `P3` | Worth keeping on the record, but nobody would schedule it deliberately. Would not be missed if it sat another year.                                                                   |

Five rules, and the first is the one that goes wrong:

1. **Priority is the consequence of _not_ doing it** — not effort, not how
   interesting it is, and never how old the issue is. A ten-minute cosmetic
   alignment fix is `P3`; a hard-to-fix data-loss bug is `P0`.
2. **`P0` is rare** — a handful across a whole backlog. More than one or two in
   your bucket means you are grading on interest. Every `P0` must name the harm
   and say what makes it ongoing.
3. **Do not inherit the tier from the item itself.** An existing priority label,
   a `critical` in the title, or an urgent-sounding author is a claim to verify
   against the code, not a tier to copy.
4. **A bucket that comes back all one tier is a failed judgement.** Expect a
   spread. If your items genuinely do cluster — single-occurrence auto-filed
   error reports are mostly `P3`, for instance — say so in your report, so the
   flat distribution reads as a finding rather than as sloppiness.
5. **Sanity-check your own ladder before you write the summary.** Read your tiers
   back as one ordered list and ask whether you would really pick every `P1`
   ahead of every `P2`. Move whatever fails that.

## Evidence standard — a verdict without evidence is discarded

Cite a path, a line, a grep result, or a commit SHA. Establish, concretely: do
the named files still exist; do the named symbols; does the described
duplication/bug/gap **still** exist; was it already fixed
(`git log --oneline --all --grep '#<n>'`, `git log -S'<symbol>'`); is a newer
open issue already covering it.

Effort scales to age: for items touched in the last two weeks, confirm they are
still live and surface the exceptions rather than deep-diving each.

## Hard read-only boundary

You may read anything and write **only your own report file**. Do not close,
comment on, label, reopen, assign, or edit any issue or PR; do not push, commit,
or run any `gh` command that writes. If you think something should be closed,
that is what your verdict is for.

## Watch for, and call out in your report

- an **umbrella issue whose own body is the only record of the work** — its
  children were never filed as issues, so closing it deletes them; they have to
  be filed separately first
- a **parent whose sub-issues _are_ filed and still open** — the opposite
  problem: the children exist, but they hang off the parent through an API-only
  link, so it reads as finished until you ask
  (`/repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>/sub_issues`)
- **unfinished security verification**, and **production data repairs that never
  ran** — never `CLOSE` these; a closed-child count can overstate how closed a
  gate is
- **product signal sitting in auto-filed prose** that is tracked in no issue
- **`TODO(#n)` comments** in the code referencing an item you judge `CLOSE`
- a **merged PR that did not actually finish** the issue it references ("schema
  only", "slice 1", "split from"), or that merged to a non-default base

## Output format

Write to the report path your prompt gave you. Two parts, in this order:

1. One `###` section per item: `### #<n> — <title>`, then your verdict, its
   priority if it survives, the evidence you established (with paths/lines/SHAs),
   and anything the coordinator needs to know.

2. A **final `## Summary` table**, the last thing in the file, in exactly this shape:

```
## Summary

| Item | Verdict | Priority | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 | CLOSE_DUPLICATE | — | Duplicate of #99; `src/foo/bar.ts:12` is the gap both name. |
| #124 | KEEP | P1 | `src/x.ts:40` still hand-rolls the parser. |
```

The table is parsed mechanically, so: one row per item you were given and no
others; `#<number>` in the first column; the verdict verbatim in caps; the
priority as `P0`–`P3` on a `KEEP` or `REFILE` and `—` on everything else; a
one-line reason citing evidence. All four columns are required — a three-column
row is rejected, as is a `KEEP` without a tier or a close with one. Escape any
literal `|` inside a reason as `\|`. If you write more than one `## Summary`
heading, the **last** one is taken as your settled position.

---

If following these rules turns up something they get wrong — a trap they do not
warn about, a step that misfires on this repo — say so at the end of your
report. The coordinator collects those for the operator; see `SKILL.md` §
"This is a living document".
