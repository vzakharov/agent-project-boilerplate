description: "STUB — not yet hydrated for this project. Investigate a question against real deployed data under an enforced read-only connection, and commit the output for review. Hydrate this file against the project's datastore and credentials setup before invoking it."

> ⚠️ **STUB.** This skill has no working procedure yet. Before it can be invoked, fill in: which environments can be probed, how a read-only connection is *enforced* (not merely intended), and where the output is written. Delete this banner once you have.

## What this skill is for

Answering "what does the data actually look like?" from the data itself, rather than from the schema, the code, or a plausible guess. Most debugging that stalls does so because everyone is reasoning about what *should* be in the database.

## Concerns that hold regardless of stack

| Concern | What a hydrated version must handle |
|---|---|
| **Enforce read-only at the transport** | This is the one that matters. Read-only must be a property of the connection — a read-only transaction, a replica endpoint, a credential with no write grant — not a promise that the queries will only be `SELECT`s. Convention fails under a typo; a credential without write permission does not. If the project can't currently offer such a connection, creating one is part of hydrating this skill, not a nice-to-have. |
| **Name the environment out loud** | Every report says which environment it read. A finding from staging presented as production is worse than no finding, and the two are indistinguishable after the fact unless it's written down. |
| **Commit the output** | Queries and results go in a file someone else can read, not just into the transcript. The reasoning is reviewable, the numbers are checkable, and the next person with the same question doesn't re-run it. Put it under `docs/remove-before-merging/` if it rides a branch, so `/finalize` sweeps it before merge. |
| **Sampling honesty** | Say how many rows were examined and over what period. "Users often do X" from a 10-row sample is a guess wearing a statistic's clothes. |
| **PII** | Real data contains real people. Aggregate where possible; redact before committing anything that will outlive the session. |

`/log-review` covers the same "look at reality rather than the code" instinct on the logging side; the PII concern is identical in both.
